    "First, let's deal with the fraction on the right side. The numerator of this fraction is x<sup>2</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> - so we're adding two exponential terms. When the terms you're adding (or subtracting) have the same exponential, you can simply add (or subtract) the coefficients. In this case, x<sup>2</sup> is the same as 1x<sup>2</sup>, which when added to 2x<sup>2</sup> gives us the result 3x<sup>2</sup>, so our equation now looks like this: \n",

    "Now that we've condolidated the numerator, let's simplify the entire fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator. When you divide exponential terms with the same variable, you simply divide the coefficients as you usually would and subtract the exponential of the denominator from the exponential of the numerator. In this case, we're dividing 3x<sup>2</sup> by 1x<sup>3</sup>: The coefficient 3 divided by 1 is 3, and the exponential 2 minus 3 is -1, so the result is 3x<sup>-1</sup>, making our equation:\n",

Multiplication, is the opposite of division, so this time we'll multipy the coefficients and add the exponentials: 3 multiplied by 2 is 6, and -1 + 4 is 3, so the result is 6x<sup>3</sup>:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}y = 3x^{3} \\end{equation}\n",
